# Solving-Data-Entry-tasks-as-a-DataScientist
## Applying the knowledge of Data Science in a Data Entry Job to finish a tedious task.


Hello 👋 and hope you're having a nice day.

🧐I believe we all agree to the role that comes with Data entry. 
HAVING TO INPUT HUGE AMOUNT OF DATA requires huge amount of work and time.
it's always frustrating when you have a huge file of a 1000 or more rows of unique data to input on every cell. 

In this repository i'll show you how i managed to solve a huge data entry task with the knowledge of Data Science.

I was to do a tedious excel data entry on 2000+ rows of data. Each row with a distinct title in a string format. i was to copy 
 each of this title and paste in google or any other search engine, go to image results, click an image to take you to the website followed by copying the resulting web address for each resulting image. In other words i was to copy the image web source.

 I had to do this for every row in 2000+ of unique data.  4hrs into the contract i was still puzzled by how to finish such a milestone.

 I started doing it the normal old fashion way, copying and pasting. Sooner than later i realized this was a huge amount of work.
 At a point i thought about rejecting the contract. I already presumed it'd take till the year 2025 to finish pasting each of those link. 

And

That's not all😆 i would still generate two new columns sub and child category. 

The contents of this new columns would be to cross-reference the title column with a file which is a list of categories and subcategories to determine which was to be assigned to which. 

Anyone that was unfamiliar would require me to consult the internet in this case google. 
All this were so much and i had till Saturday to finish this task. 

After about 9hrs of constant thinking and getting out of frustration into another, a thought ran into my shell.

 Python became an  anthem that sank deep into my ears from no where. i then thought to myself, why don't i try python. It's about time data science came into the battle field.

 It was one among multifarious ideas with low chances of delivering but i took my chances and gave it my absolute focus. 


I began to write my imagination and what exactly it is that i needed.  Mind you I've had a pen 🖊🖋 and a book 📚 throughout my thinking process.

Knowledge truly is power. 
After a couple of hours of research, constructing, getting errors and reconstructing i finally hit mined silver. 🥲

To cut the story short i was able to generate the web links to each title  without having to do the hardwork all thanks to OpenAI. 

Although i had to ask questions multiple times each time rephrasing and restructuring my code to get a better results. 

90% of the time i got an inconsistent code I'd close my laptops lid and step out untill another idea came and i bought the last one. 

🥸 Python literally did what was supposed to be hardwork  in a  couple of lines. Thought about completing the whole task with python so i spent an extra hour reading through my category to know how to define each title assignments. i had about 62 subcategory and 12 categories to assign to 2000+ of data. 

 It all came out great with a huge smile on my clients face as i turned up sooner than expected. 😎This calls for a tip don't you agree? 😄
